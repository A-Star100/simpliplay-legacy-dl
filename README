**The source code for the legacy version is in the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-desktop/tree/legacy).**
**This repository is only a direct download repository for the legacy version, as we don't want it interfering with the main repository's downloads as it may confuse users.**
**Thanks for understanding.**
